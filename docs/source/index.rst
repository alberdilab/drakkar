Welcome to DRAKKAR's documentation!
===================================

**DRAKKAR** is a snakemake-based genome-resolved metagenomics pipeline optimised for Mjolnir. 
Snakemake works along with Slurm to conduct the long pipeline using the optimal memory and time resources. 
It is built in a modular fashion, so that the entire workflow or only parts of it can be executed.

Check out the :doc:`usage` section for further information, including
